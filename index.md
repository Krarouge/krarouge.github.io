## Motivation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breweries are becoming more and more popular nowadays, each of them proposing beers with unique flavors. Appreciated by casual beer drinkers and craft beer enthusiasts, beers happen to be a thriving market. A rising amount of new breweries have emerged in the last decades.  When starting a new brewery, the choice of location of the brewery is a significant step to guarantee its success. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several factors to consider when choosing a location for a brewery such as the access to raw materials (water, hops, barley, and yeast), the proximity to customers, zoning laws and regulations, costs of renting or buying property, and competition with other breweries. For this project, we were interested to distinguish the difference between urban and rural breweries. 

## Goal

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project aims to give advice to new brewers and indicate if they should install themselves in a crowded city or in the calm countryside. A look will also be given into beer styles and what differences can be found between beer crafted in urban area and in rural area.

## Research questions

- Are there major differences between urban and rural breweries? 
- Do breweries in big cities perform better in general? 
- Is it the same for small breweries ?
-  Are there specific features related to urban or rural breweries?

## Dataset description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used a dataset on beer reviews provided by the [RateBeer website](https://www.ratebeer.com/) which collected over 7 millions reviews for a period of 17 years (2001-2017). It includes :
- metadata about 442k beers, 24k breweries, and 70k users
- ratings across different aspects: appearance, aroma, palate and taste
- a textual review
- users' and breweries' country
- beer styles
